/**
 * Creates a map using the config object. This sets up the initial style object, toggleable layers
 * from the config, and creates a generated style equal to the provided config.style. When the map
 * loads the config will be generated from the received map style and features will then be added.
 * Setting the genrated style here just allows for the map to load initially and after map load
 * it should only be set by `createStylesForAllMaps`.
 *
 * Ideally, this is done at application start time, and when the `<Map>` component gets mounted
 * it recieves this initial style. Then when the map loads, the style is then set to the fully
 * loaded style returned from the map and then we generate from that style a style with all the
 * layers and features. Everytime features get updated a new style is generated and sent to the map.
 * This happens until the map is unloaded, then we stop updating that maps style.
 *
 * Config example:
 * ```
 * config = {
 *   id: 'map1', // required
 *   style: 'mapbox://url.to.map', // can also be the style object itself.
 *   toggleableLayers: ['ais', 'omnicom', 'radar'],  // optional list of layers
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param {object} config the map configuration, that at a minimum contains id and style. Can also
 *                        contain list of layer ids that are toggleable (visible/hidden) on the
 *                        property `toggleableLayers`
