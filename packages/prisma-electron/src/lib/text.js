/**
 * Returns a truncated version of the string provided with the ellipsis added to the end of the
 * string. If the string is less than the length, it will just return the string.
 *
 * If a newline exists on the string, the trucated string will be split on the newline, so even if
 * the string is longer than length, if a newline occurs before length then the full string before
 * the newline is returned.
 *
 * Spacing is also taken into account and will be trimmed from the end of the string
 * before the ellipsis is added. So the resulting string length may be less than the length param.
 *
 * @param {string} str The string to truncate.
 * @param {int} length The max length of the string. Will truncate to be exactly this length
 *                     if the provided string is longer than that length including the added
 *                     ellipsis. Default 20 characters.
 *
 * @return {string} The trucated string. Guranteed to be less than or equal to `length`.
 *                  Returns empty string if input string is null or undefined.
 *
 * Eg.
 * ```
 * const title = 'This is a note that is long. ';
 * const trunc = getTruncatedTitleString(title, 10);
 * -> 'This is...'
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * const title = 'This is\n a note that is long. ';
 * const trunc = getTruncatedTitleString(title, 10);
 * -> 'This is'
 * ```
