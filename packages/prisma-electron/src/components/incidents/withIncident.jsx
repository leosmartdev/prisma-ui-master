 * Provides access to Incident data.
 *
 * TODO: There are a number of things remaining to clean this up.
 * - We need to create the branch HOC to handle loading and null states (they are passed in as func
 *   params to withIncident, not on the child comp) EG
 * ```
 * withIncident(
 *   props => ({ props.id }),
 *   <IncidentDetailsLoading />,
 *   <IncidentDetailsEmpty />,
 * )(Wrapped);
 * ```
 * - Right now, for IncidentDetails HOC order matters for mapPropsToRequest (name isn't great for
 *   that func either). Order matters because we grab the match params to get the id and return it,
 *   but the props come from this HOC not just the child Component. Unsure if we can get around
 *   this but we should investigate.

/**
 * withIncident wraps a component that requires a single Incident as it's data input. This HOC
 * will provide the following props to the inner Component:
 *  - incident {object} The requested incident from the server (or redux store). Null if not found
 *    or loading
 *  - incidentIsLoading {bool} Informs the child if there is an outstanding incident request with
 *    the server.
 *  - multicasts {array} List of all outstanding multicasts for this incident. Empty array if no
 *    multicasts are found. Completed multicasts will not be removed from the list if they created
 *    using `forwardIncidentToSite`, but no completed multicasts will be added during mount.
 *  - onSave {func} Callback to save the incident. `onSave(updatedIncident: object) => Promise`
 *  - onLogEntrySave {func} Callback to update a log entry.
 *    `onLogEntrySave(logEntry: object) => Promise(incident, RequestError)`
 *  - onLogEntryRemove {func} Callback to remove a log entry.
 *    `onLogEntryRemove(id: string) => Promise`
 *  - onLogEntryAdd {func} Callback to add a log entry.
 *    `onLogEntryAdd(logEntry: string) => Promise`
 *  - onCloseIncident {func} Callback to close an incident. Requires IncidentCommander privileges.
 *    `onCloseIncident(outcome: string, synopsis: string) => Promise`
 *  - onReopenIncident {func} Callback to reopen an incident. Requires IncidentCommander privileges.
 *    `onReopenIncident(reason: string) => Promise`
 *  - forwardIncidentToSite {func} Starts forwarding an incident to the provided site.
 *    `forwardIncidentToSite(site: object) => Promise`
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 * ``
 * export default withIncident(props => ({ incidentId: props.incidentId }))(WrappedComponent);
 * ```
 *
 * With Params:
 * ```
 * export default withIncident((props) => {
 *   const { incidentId } = props;
 *   const params = {
 *     someGetParam: 'value',
 *     includeLogEntries: false,
 *   };
 *
 *   return {
 *     incidentId,
 *     params,
 *   };
 * })(WrappedComponent);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {func} mapPropsToRequest Maps the incoming props to the request values needed to get
 *     the incident. Expected to return incidentId of the incident to retrieve, and optional params
 *     object if GET params need to be passed to the request. Will be called when the component is
 *     mounting and on all prop updates.
 *     `mapPropsToRequest(props: object) => { incidentId: string, params: object}`
