 * # Initializes the redux store and all required middleware.
 *
 * ## Middleware
 *
 * Currently we are using 3 middlewares:
 *  - redux-thunk: Primarily for REST calls.
 *  - redux-observable: New middleware, expected to be used for multicast and websockets initially.
 *    may take over some or all of the REST calls depending.
 *  - logger: debug mode and with redux logger initialized, this will print out redux before/after
 *    log messages on every store update.
 *
 * ## Adding reducers and epics
 *
 * Every redux file throughout the app has an init() function if they need to add a reducer or an
 * epic to the store. The init functions are imported and called below. If you need to add a new
 * init function, import it and call it in the addReducers function below.
 *
 * Every init function takes a single parameter that is the store. The store has two custom
 * functions we have added, addEpic and addReducer. This will add an epic or a reducer to the redux
 * store.
