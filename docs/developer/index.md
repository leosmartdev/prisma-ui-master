# PRISMA UI Developer Guide

We have three packages currently in the repository

 - prisma-electron: The main PRISMA RCC/Fleet electron application
 - @prisma/map: Framework for building maps built on mapbox-gl and react.
 - @prisma/ui: Framework collection of common UI components for PRISMA applications.

## Storybook

 Each has a storybook showing the components available and how to use them. This is also heavily used
 in development of new components.

 As we build more parts of the application, more components will be pushed into the ui package
 and be placed in storybook.

## RESTFul API

We currently use postman for all REST documentation and development. [See online documentation](https://orolia-prisma-c2.postman.co/collections/352230-e1e86aaf-b2c3-4e3b-b718-a74f4b7a0281?workspace=44d15d8d-0a82-4c95-8e74-d196d18dd868)
for more information.

Over the next few releases, we plan to flesh out the REST documentation more and start versioning the
APIs in postman.
